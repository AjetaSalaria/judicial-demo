                            <p>TranscriptMiner<sup>SM</sup> is a pre-startup business, conceived (with the help of many friends and colleagues) by Jeffrey Gettleman, former partner in the Restructuring Group at Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  The prototype, enhanced by your feedback, will be used as the basis for the first round of external funding.  Once there is “money in the bank” the transcript database will be expanded to more judicial districts and judges, additional analytical tools will be added, and sales and other personnel will be hired, to enable the business to reach the next level.  The plan is to expand the database and product from a Bankruptcy Court-only product to US District Courts.
